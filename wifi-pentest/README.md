# WiFi Penetration Testing Framework

A comprehensive educational tool for learning about WiFi security and penetration testing. This framework simulates various WiFi attacks for classroom use and ethical hacking education.

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

This tool is for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**. Unauthorized access to computer networks is illegal. Only use this tool on networks you own or have explicit written permission to test.

## Features

### Network Discovery
- Scan for nearby WiFi networks
- Discover connected clients
- Real-time signal strength monitoring
- Channel usage analysis
- Encryption type detection (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3, OPEN)

### WEP Attacks
- **FMS Attack**: Exploits weak IV patterns to recover WEP keys
- **KoreK Attack**: Statistical attack using 16 classes of weak IVs
- **Chop-Chop Attack**: Decrypts packets byte by byte without the key
- **Fragmentation Attack**: Obtains keystream fragments for packet injection
- **ARP Replay**: Generates new IVs by replaying ARP packets
- **IV Analysis**: Real-time weak IV detection and analysis

### WPA/WPA2 Attacks
- **4-Way Handshake Capture**: Captures authentication handshakes
- **Dictionary Attack**: Brute-force attack using wordlists
- **PMKID Attack**: Attacks RSN IE PMKID in WPA3 transition mode
- **WPS Pixie Dust**: Exploits weak random number generation in WPS

### Deauthentication Attacks
- Targeted deauth against specific clients
- Broadcast deauth against all clients
- Beacon flood for network confusion
- Configurable reason codes and packet rates

### Visualization & Analysis
- Real-time packet rate graphs
- IV distribution analysis
- Channel usage heat maps
- Signal strength monitoring
- Attack progress tracking
- Encryption type breakdown

### Packet Capture
- Live packet capture simulation
- Protocol filtering (WEP, WPA, Beacon, Data, Auth, Deauth)
- Hex and ASCII packet views
- Detailed packet analysis
- Export to PCAP/JSON formats
